I am interested in awkward, surreal, unnatural, and unor- ganized bodily states by objectifying the body and the space. My work is an examination of how a body in a void space can function as image, figure, excess, or naturalized site for gaze. The in- clusion of the viewer is key in my work. The body and its movement are a metaphor for my state of mind. It is a place where all my conflicts come together in that moment. Having lived three different lives—in India, Dubai and the U.S.—I realized I had developed multiple personalities that helped me fit into each culture while still keeping my own values intact. The bells are sym- bolic of my culture and past and keep me bound, become a rhythm, and constantly remind me who I really am. Traditions can be very impractical and unreasonable, but living in today means being practical and reasonable. There is also a sense of emancipation in my works. This sense of liberation is from the social, spiritual and material world.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Bhadviya/Detail_2_Bhadviya_Shedded.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Shedded</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Photo Luster Print</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">32 x 28 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        <div class=\"player\">\n                            \n                            <video width=\"320\" height=\"240\" controls>\n                                <source src=\"http://sandbox.anthonywarnick.com/gradbook/video/main_Bhadviya_Skin.large1080p.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n                            </video>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"vid_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"vid_title\">Skin, 2015</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"vid_materials\"></p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"vid_dementions\"></p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n\n                    \n                        <div class=\"player\">\n                            \n                            <video width=\"320\" height=\"240\" controls>\n                                <source src=\"http://sandbox.anthonywarnick.com/gradbook/video/2_Bhadviya_A_Desire_To_Shed.large1080p.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n                            </video>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"vid_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"vid_title\">Skin, 2015</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"vid_materials\"></p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"vid_dementions\"></p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n\n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

By focusing on media trends and the dissemination of societal occurrences through the news, I chose to source imagery from popular media, as well as social media leaks, and adapt them to exist within alternate scenarios. As a practice that serves as a bridge between installation, sculpture, and photographs, my work addresses past historical issues and their connections within a contemporary frame. I first sculpt and install a tabletop tableau, and then photograph the situation as a still life. I chose to use photography to reference the history of propaganda posters, as well as Dada collage. The usage of colors and political figures form a symbolic lexicon that runs throughout the series: specific color choices allude to “color revolutions”, while party supplies hint at the doctrines of political parties. Each of the photographs addresses a specific time in Middle Eastern history, while alluding to how both the East and West have responded to societal occurrences.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Soleimani/detail_soleimani.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Illuminated</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Archival Pigment Print</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">17 x 24 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Soleimani/detail_2_soleimani.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Tanned</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Archival Pigment Print</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">17 x 24 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

Stills. Still life. It’s still life. Distilled life. Our systems of living have become increasingly virtualized, impacting directly on our perception of the world. The digitalization of the image has created the disappearance of the photograph, and in turn, the disappearance of the object. As stated by John Berger, “For the first time ever, images of art have become ephemeral, ubiquitous, insubstantial, available, valueless, free. They surround us in the same way as a language surrounds us.” Our interactions with the world have been reduced to the images we access while participating in the endless scroll. All objects are available at our fingertips, and indeed, through the interface of a keyboard and mouse, our fingertips are often the only way we tactilely engage with many of them. Images are seductive. We take their validity for granted. I consider myself to be a choreographer of objects, using action as translation as a way of entering this space between the real and the digital.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Brewster/Detail_1_Brewster.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">A Pair of mirrors Facing each Other</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Video and Found Objects</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">30 x 24 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Brewster/Detail_2_Brewster.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">A Pair of mirrors Facing each Other</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Video and Found Objects</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">30 x 24 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

The sunlight shines in through the trees and the sound of others working keeps me focused on my task.<br /><br />I make coil pots. Sometimes I use a jagged rib to blend the coils but most times I don’t. I like the way coils look; coils speak the language of time and movement—they come together to develop form and move ‘round and ‘round reminding me that I too have travelled that path.<br /><br />Some of my pots get painted all over with glazes and underglazes; others are left with large areas of raw clay exposed. The faces, colors, and imagery on my pots are inspired by the moment. I like to make decisions very quickly and without much deliberation, paying attention to how they feel. I pick up five ran- dom jugs of color and apply them liberally in heavy globs—I get caught up in watching them cascade down its face—I follow their edges with a carving tool—I know it’s finished when I’m done.<br /><br />I use various firing techniques. I fire my pots in an electric kiln when I want to try and control things or I’ll use a gas kiln with the addition of soda or salt when I want to roll the dice and be surprised. Opening a kiln is always magical.<br /><br />Conceptually, I am enamored of the idea of artistic vision. It’s so puzzling and strange that I have this innate and strong desire to build things and then paint all over them. I often feel anxiety and confusion in trying to understand the paradoxical mix of being and becoming that we call existence; making coil pots keeps me centered. Helping them find their place in the world makes me feel at home.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Laurents/Detail_1_Laurents.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Lawn Party</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Ceramic, Fake Fruit, Tablecloth</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">Dimensions Variable</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Laurents/Detail_2_Laurents.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Pot Stack</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Ceramic</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">6 x 6 x 36 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Laurents/Detail_5_Laurents.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Pots & Figurines</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Ceramic</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">Dimensions Variable</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Laurents/Detail_4_Laurents.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Pizza Closet</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Ceramic, Wood, Pizza Costumes, Hangers, Clown Nose</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">Dimensions Variable</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

Although not much has changed, she was a weird, chubby, sad, sensitive kid growing up - her aunt’s hairdresser used to call her an “old lost soul.” She shares a birthday with Jane Goodall, Eddie Murphy, Alec Baldwin and Marlon Brando. If these are any indications of her future, she will save animals, tell jokes on stage, become an A-list movie star and then throw it all away by becoming a fat raging alcoholic.

Taking the inconsequentially absurd from pop culture and the unconscious along with my own internal existential musings, seems to allow an interesting juxtaposition of seemingly unrelated things. But I realize they are related—like the two sides of a coin, night and day, and the duality of human nature. However, I would like to complicate these things further by blurring the lines and seeing what can exist between the polarities.<br/><br/>Currently, in the context of the subjects aforementioned, drawing has become as central as object making in my practice. The former satisfies my need for immediacy, and the latter operates as a way to express the monumental. I believe that seeing the hand in my work is as important as the concept as it assists in lending a sort of honesty; a virtue that is important to me as a maker.<br/><br/>Though not always obvious or present, growing up in a highly politicized area of L.A. and the psychic residual trauma of race relations, gangs, identity, culture, class, apathy, activism, victory and defeat is a motivating factor of my work. I understand that, as an artist, I make work to negotiate these difficult and often contradictory terrains to better understand the world I come from and the world I live in.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Murakami/detail_1_Murakami.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">You Have Been Here Before</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Paper Mache, Graphite, Projection Installation</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">Dimensions Variable</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Murakami/detail_3_Murakami.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Drawings</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Marker, Graphite, On Paper</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\"></p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Murakami/detail_4_Murakami.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Drawings</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Marker, Graphite, On Paper</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\"></p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

There may be a way to open up what an object means, through its relationship to something else and also by how it is represented. At a certain moment, we have to cross haptic lines and encounter what things actually are: a photo, a readymade, a copy, a blob. I am invested in the things we look past when we are involved with trying to construct a narrative.<br/><br/><strong>Regarding the Use of Images:</strong><br/>False beliefs have the potential to influence the way that we live at the level of reality—just as an image can perform within, and even structure how we understand a situation. Perhaps the perception of real things can become blurred in deceit, and it is not so easy anymore to define which part is the image or the reconstruction, even if we know on a cognitive level exactly what things are.

I love putting hard and soft things together to see how they act with and on one another. I shift the weight, volume and connections between parts, and observe changes in how they prop themselves up or sag and droop. These behaviors mimic the body, and like with bodily gestures, can express joy, pride, sorrow, and yearning. Despite the artificial color palette of my objects, materials such as silicone, fabric, and steel evoke muscle, skin, and bone which leads to an uncanny familiarity in the work and the desire to touch. Though I do not portray the figure outright, the literal and metaphorical weight is understood through our experience of our own bodies, and how they change with age and according to emotional state—wrinkly skin, slumped posture, knobby toes. Realizing humor has always been a source of tremendous joy in my life and a way of dealing with challenging situations, in the last two years a certain playfulness has also become an important part of the work.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Eisner/detail_1_eisner.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Untitled</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Steel, Paint</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">Dimensions Variable</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Eisner/detail_3_eisner.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Good House</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Paper, Steel</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">28 x 10 x 10 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Eisner/detail_4_eisner.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Untitled</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Silicone Rubber, Wire </p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">18 x 11 x 10 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

With the help of the computers in our pockets, we take pictures and videos, send messages to friends and strangers, check the weather, find people to date, add to our ever-growing calendars and lists of things to do, and map our destinations. The mobile phone has seamlessly integrated itself into our lives through its usefulness and convenience, and it is one of the few objects we keep almost as close to our bodies as the fabric that divides it from us. Its usefulness began with the ability to communicate with others around the world and near to us at any location we choose (as long as we have service). Yet as we are able to communicate from further away, are our connections to one another as deep as they once were? Although we can peer into each other’s lives with the push of a button, using symbols instead of words to comment on the moments we observe, we pare down our communication with our family and friends, choosing images to convey our thoughts. How has this affected human behavior and relationships? Change is a constant; who we are as people changes every moment. With the advent of social media, our changing selves can be observed by strangers, the government, our employers, our family, and our friends. We are touching from a distance, through panes of glass.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Alonge/detail1_alonge.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">If You Don’t Like It</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Cotton, Vinyl, Pompoms, Pedestal, Slipcover, Rhinestones </p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">60 x 36 x 24 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Alonge/detail3_alonge.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Starting As Low As</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Found Fabrics, Cotton, Vinyl, Synthetics, Embroidery, Chain, Grommets, Hooks, Rhinestones</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">60 x 48 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

It is in this liminal space where I stand at the threshold and explore spiritual connections and the potential to transform feelings of powerlessness and alienation.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Pescador/Detail_4_Pescador.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Conspire (detail)</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Antique Handkerchiefs, Cotton Yarn, Plastic Tarp, Latex Tubing</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">Dimensions Variable</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Pescador/Detail_5_Pescador.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Tallit Katan</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Sisal Rope, Wood</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">40 x 96 x 9 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

These works mimic how skin functions to hold the inner body in place, as well as its wondrous malleability to stretch from the internal outward, accommodating extra fat, a tumor, and a fetus. As it resembles such membrane and internal organs, this series parallels skin, bone, and body fluids that make up our common, yet mysterious interior compositions.<br/><br/>Engaging craft as process is an important part of my work. Craft and body beautification methods signify an obsession with ideal beauty, a human fantasy only objects are able to embody.

The projects pursue the aesthetic of abstraction and create ambiguity through form. My work focuses on material honesty and the essence of structure.

However, when I ask myself and my peers “what can we do to make these conditions better?” sometimes we don’t want to think that these problems are our responsibility. It seems to be selfish of me to be so bothered by the problem, but refuse to address these issues in my own work. The deeper I dig down into the problem, the more I understand that many of these issues lie in our culture. We live it, breathe it, and entertain it. We are part of the problem.<br/>Design has the power to create cultural values, set trends, and improve existing conditions by reaching a mass audience. This is a great potential that designers cannot waste by keeping it in only the commercial world. Can design objects be more than setting visual trends? Can design objects facilitate conversations relating to social issues? Can design create products for the minds and not just for functional use? I want to blur the lines between design / art / craft and to engage design in conversations relating the cultures, people, politics, and physical environment.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Sinchai/Detail_1_Sinchai.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Body As Site I</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Sterling Silver</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">25 x 14 x 7 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Sinchai/Detail_2_Sinchai.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Body As Site II</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Plated Gold</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">10 x 11 x 15 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

We lived at one with nature surrounded by a river, rich farmland, and framed with mountains. The land provided all of our needs. Life was both simple and rich at the same time.<br/><br/>My interest in art, design, and living spaces is rooted in creating living spaces that transport people from today’s complex and stressful world back to the simple life I remember by just closing a door.<br/><br/>My work is inspired by my parents. My father was a Buddhist Monk and the center of our village was the temple. Our religion is based on the concept of preserving and honoring nature as a way of life. My mother was a weaver who used the most basic materials to make her silk come alive with vibrant and rich color. My architectural inspiration has been Frank Lloyd Wright’s Usonian designs as they capture the essence of nature, simplicity and elegance.<br/><br/>These influences have shaped my work as I have spent years learning and applying my craft in spaces that soothe the soul and pro- vide livable, functional and comfortable living.

A signature 2D logo becomes jewelry with the meaning of the logo itself and brings memorial value. A visual trick of wall painting demonstrates how humans perceive the world through our sensory system — there is a large number of neurons, and these neurons can only either signal or not signal. In other words, most parts of our brain carry out the same kinds of computations on whatever type of information that went into them. So if we understand vision, we understand fundamental things about how we see, hear, smell, or even think.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Chou/detail_2_chou.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Wall Painting</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Oil Paints</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">3120 x 190 x 150 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Chou/detail_4_chou.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Line in Space model</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Wood and Oil Paints</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">14 x 6.4 x 3.3 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

I searched the County’s surplus property list starting in December of 2013 and purchased this parcel, a former railway easement next to a small lake, for $250.<br/>I am interested in the politics of land use, especially the role of forgotten, underutilized, or decommissioned parcels in urban areas. Interactions between infrastructure and urban programs often place zoning and landscape conditions at odds. The geometry of manmade landscape and “natural” landscapes give rise to spaces that go unused as time passes and socio-economic conditions change. These in-between spaces are places where urbanity comes into conflict, approaches conditions it cannot reconcile, or changes in relevance over time.<br/>I built a cabin on my land to experiment with my thoughts on building. Permanence and time- scale take a large role in my decision making, particularly in the interaction between the building and the ground. Since I am self-funding the project, I work to reduce construction costs and find opportunities to add value through design, making use of digital fabrication and modification of inexpensive materials and components. With the cabin on site I use it as a tool for observation of the property, learning about the relationship between architecture and the evolution of environmental factors in a city.<br/>Finally–this project has demonstrated to me my interest in operating the work I design, retooling my practice from a fee-for-service model to design-build investment projects. This approach has given me more opportunity to positively affect the context of my work, changing my role from taste-maker to stake-holder.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Elkin/detail_elkin_2.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\"></p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Vacant Parcel;

This new economy of land ownership naturally foregrounds the experimental due to minimal financial risk and the abandoned state of the township: Pontiac.</p><p>The awareness that I would abandon my land 9 months after purchase started to form my thesis. The land would have to exist on its own. Even as it is a part of a community, it will have its own biotope; it will be the entire world on its own, an intrinsically animate place.</p><br/><br/><strong>Materiality / Time and Abandonment.</strong><p>Secondly it started to form a view upon materiality and time. If the land and its nested interventions were to be abandoned, then seeds for a beautiful decay and a wish to facilitate new growth should be planted.</p><strong>Place / Measurement.</strong><br/><p>I believe, that if I devote myself carefully enough to the study of the site’s natural characteristics and atmosphere, my interventions on the site will respond to the place, a response where architectural form will emerge almost by itself.</p><strong>Details / The Constructed and Earth</strong><p>I am fascinated by details: architectural details and the earth’s details. Works of architecture must reflect the admirable workings of the earth. A specific response to the place where they stand, without neglecting the fact that architecture is a product of our desire to change.</p><p>The moving material, water, is the most amazing material on earth. My structures are changing rain’s speed, density, and direction in order to facilitate growth. Water and life is in a remarkably sophisticated relationship that is mediated by the sun. If architecture exists to serve our needs, then water should influence architecture’s form and appearance.</p>\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Froege/froege_1.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Axonometric, 1-50 Sitemodel</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Plaster, Alminium.

Two elderly women are at a Catskills mountain resort, and one of them says: “Boy, the food at this place is really terrible.” The other one says, “Yeah, I know ... and such small portions.” Well, that’s essentially how I feel about my work: it’s terrible ... and there isn’t enough of it. Of course I kid ... mostly. Graduate school has an amazing way of messing with you and making you lose all confidence, then building you back up again, only to take it all away once more, and leave you thinking “hrmm what am I doing?” Well despite that I do know that I am interested in how to use humor and seductive imagery to pull people into a contemplative space regarding issues that I ruminate on in day-to-day life, be they small or large. Often pulling from personal experiences to try and poke fun at institutions in a subversive and satirical way. A sense of humor has always been important to me, and that is certainly an influence of the un- healthy (borderline dangerous) amount of popular culture that I consume on a daily basis. This pop culture obsession also feeds my fascination with seductive imagery, often in the form of the slick advertisements that I am bombarded with between the tasty nougats of pop culture. Although all those flashing images and pulsing sounds may be rotting my brain – they have taught me that a gleaming surface can be a nice entryway for a subversive idea.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Carolan/detail_1_carolan.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">New Voting Tech</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Voting booth, VHS tapes, SD video</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">3 x 3 x 6 ft.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Carolan/detail_3_carolan.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Rural</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Risograph Print</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">11 x 17 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Carolan/detail_2_carolan.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Somehow, I...</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">HD Video</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">1080 x 1920 Pixels</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        <div class=\"player\">\n                            \n                            <video width=\"320\" height=\"240\" controls>\n                                <source src=\"http://sandbox.anthonywarnick.com/gradbook/video/detail_3-VIDEO_carolan.large1080p.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n                            </video>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"vid_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"vid_title\">, </p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"vid_materials\"></p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"vid_dementions\"></p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n\n                    \n                        <div class=\"player\">\n                            \n                            <video width=\"320\" height=\"240\" controls>\n                                <source src=\"http://sandbox.anthonywarnick.com/gradbook/video/detail_4-VINDEO_carolan.large1080p.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n                            </video>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"vid_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"vid_title\">, </p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"vid_materials\"></p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"vid_dementions\"></p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n\n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

My father is a collector. He used to lure me into going on “adventure drives” only to wind up in some small shop in a town on its last breath, with junk yards, garage sales, or through-city alleyways just in case something might catch his eye. Now I do similar things on the computer.<br/><br/>Though graphic design has always been around me, I came across it circuitously. I am influenced by FOMO, reality shows and Jacques Foucault and his theory on identity as “. . .a shifting temporary construction.” Through short videos disseminated via Youtube I learned that design, like acting, must be done with enough conviction in order to suspend or entertain a new reality.

She received her BFA in Illustration from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2012. As her work became increasingly graphic, and her interest in further studying design grew, she began to study 2D at Cranbrook Academy of Art (though she still spends the majority of her time drawing).

Through my interest in the female’s historical and contemporary role in art and design, I have developed a practice that largely revolves around pattern-making.<br/><br/>The historical weight of pattern-making places it within a feminine dialogue that not only harkens to my alignment with feminism, but re-examines decidedly masculine traits of art such as vertical hierarchy and favors a more lateral plane. By experimenting with various media and presentations, I have incorporated this particular line of thinking and pattern-making into my work in an attempt to illustrate the ongoing internal struggles that I have as a woman, and most importantly, a person.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Jackson/detail_4_jackson.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">The Well Educated Man</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Digital Collage</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">20 x 30 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Jackson/detail_2_jackson.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Are We Ready To Go Home Yet?</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Digital Collage</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">18 x 32 in. ea.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

I am fascinated by the complexity of layers that derives from it. Specifically, its relations to life and development. We should never get too comfortable in anything because everything has the possibility to change, whether we like it or not. Endings were always too finite and placed conclusions on things that didn’t necessarily need them. Life is so intricate and more complicated than that. Sometimes it’s good. Sometimes it’s down right messy. I value both.<br/>Design has its own processes. It has provided me with a platform to share my own: loss and grief, identity struggles as a black woman, growing up in an underprivileged background, and the impact of abusive relationships. These messy moments built character that I aimed to understand during my time at Cranbrook. It served as a feedback loop between myself and the audience.<br/>Though we may feel tempted to create for the sake of “art’s sake” or for our own amusement, I believe that design has a greater responsibility to encourage fresh critical thinking about events greater than our selves. I had a great need to combine various elements of the audial, written, and visual communication in my work. Not only did I learn to understand myself more through focus and productivity, I believe that self-determination inspired my passion even more.<br/>I am interested in the sharing of various processes that includes my own and those of others. I look for conversations that are critical but also can provide healthy and productive growth after struggle. I aim to connect with people with similar stories and to shine a light on these communities to people who wouldn’t necessarily interact with them.

If so one would need to rethink practice in more spatial and territorial terms. The designers would have to re-position themselves perpendicular to everything else, on the other side of a forcefully dug trench, isolated and insular, but is this utopia or escapism? Fredric Jameson in his essay, Varieties of the Utopian, goes on to describe:<br/><br/>“(that such) a premise is not without all kinds of momentous consequences. In more(’s utopia), to be sure closure is achieve(d) the founder causes to be dug between the island and the mainland that of a great trench which alone allows it to become a utopia in the first place. A radical secession further underscored by the Machiavellian ruthlessness of utopian foreign policy which—with its bribery, assassination, mercenaries, and other forms of real- politik—rebukes all Christian notions of universal brotherhood and natural law and decrees the foundational difference between them and us, foe and friend, in a peremptory manner worthy of Carl Schmitt and characteristic in one way or another of all subsequent utopias...”<br/><br/>This reproach or retribution could be easily compared to the dogma that engulfed the 90s and is still witnessed today, but such aggressive and isolation on my part only proved to heighten my anxiety, so I sought another route. Turning to a process that utilized extroversion rather than secession, I began making work in conversation with the books and essays I was reading at the time. I attempted to overturn any sense of hierarchy, escaping both the mental barricades as well as the physical walls surrounding us here at Cranbrook.”<br/><br/>—Excerpt from a talk given during Second Year Presentations.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Wise/Detail1.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Models, Prescriptions, Shifts, and Limits With</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">2 Book Set: 172 Pp.

Currently, she resides in Pontiac, Michigan, where she is an MFA candidate at Cranbrook Academy of Art.\n                    </div>\n                \n\n                \n                <div class =\"statment\">\n                    These paintings are verbs. My paintings seduce the viewer with the promise of tactile exploration and harness their gaze in an implication of closeness. They speak of desire, they want and wish, they stand elemental in their craving and fascination. This body of work invites you to enter the challenge of disclosure. They encourage a request beyond the surface, to find more, to mine further, without ever fully answering. They strike a tension between representation and hiding through a delicate betrayal of longing for what lies underneath.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Brooks/main_brooks.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">I'll Try Yours</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Oil Painting</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">9.5 x 5.5 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Brooks/subsequent_1_brooks.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">But Bluer, Too</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Oil on canvas</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">8 x 8 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

Transition simultaneously participates in and departs from the ritual of gender adherence. If stasis reflects the norm, then movement itself necessarily acts as disruptor. Re-entry to the social order on the opposite side of the binary might well, with or without intent, go unrecognized as actively initiated change. Equally legitimate is the possibility of comfortably occupying a space between states.<br/><br/>My work transmits from that place “in between.” It’s at home in ambiguity. There is sharp focus on faintly uncanny events, strategic saturation, obscuring, heightening and placidity. The surface extends an invitation but obscures the subject’s potential engagement. The paintings gently defy and emphatically permit. By queering viewer proximity to whos, whats, whys and hows, the work urges self-implication in those questions, ultimately conveying consciousness of an individual, queer-lived experience.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Colombo/detail_1_colombo.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Sucker</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Oil, Canvas</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">20 x 20 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Colombo/detail_2_colombo.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Stealth</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Oil, Canvas</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">14 x 14 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Colombo/detail_3_colombo.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Untitled</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Oil, Canvas</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">30 x 40 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

The collapse of process within the picture plane sabotages the truthfulness of the image, reaching beyond broad romantics of a hackneyed aesthetic. They box with the impossibility of a two-dimensional transcendence. The paintings are sincere in their impossibility to do what they are created to do. I posit painting as a literary device, not entirely capable of activating its own history, while also considering contemporary access or in-access to that historicity. These re-combinations, re-presentations become an amalgam monster, crippling the symbology depicted. These works evade easy gesture toward lineage, which degrades as squarely as anything else.

I am interested in creating an artificial reality and an experience of self-effacing beauty, queering and denying a sublime experience with craft materiality. Using kitsch craft store media such as micah flakes, glitter, and neon chalk powder, the paintings flicker between both a reverence to and a feminist subversion of the masculinity of historical modernism. As opposed to a revelatory experience, the surfaces are flickering, elusive, and ultimately push the viewer away from the potential for sublimation. What fills these flickering spaces is a void or existential absence, a hovering veil that alludes to something behind the space that is unreachable, the unknowable Other.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Tallmadge/detail_1_tallmadge.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">You</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Oil, Mica, and Powdered Pigment On Canvas</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">36 x 96 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Tallmadge/detail_5_tallmadge.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Infinite Regression</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Oil, Glitter, and Neon Powder On Canvas</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">48 x 48 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Tallmadge/detail_4_tallmadge.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Untitled</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Oil, Wax, Glitter, Mica, and Rhinestones On Silk </p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">36 x 48 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

In my work, I analyze the situations where a human is confronted by a brand identity that transcends time and location, and can even come to symbolize whole cities, industries and histories. Despite the implicit grandiosity, though, these entities’ traction comes mainly from a continent-wide quilt of branded storefront facades. If there is no lesson to learn by focusing in on the ubiquity of these subjects, then there is a reality worth exposing. To undress the advertisements, logos, signage and architecture – the corporate broadcasts that I’m most interested in – I employ three semi-independent art practices of different levels of objectivity, and using different media:<br/><br/>COLLAGE/PAINTING:<br/>Works on canvas or paper appropriating from logos, advertisements, fine art precedents, and digital environments.<br/>PHOTO-REAL:<br/>Objective documentary photography manifested in book form.<br/>PHOTO-FAKE:<br/>Fictional narratives enacted through real-life impositions.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Webner/detail_1_webner.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Outposts</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">375 Page Catalogue of Every Comerica Bank in Metropolitan Detroit</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">9 x 6 x 1.5 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Webner/detail_2_webner.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Hephaistos Investor Quarterly</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Pamphlet</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">8.5 x 11 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Webner/detail_4_webner.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Conquistador Michelin Man at the St. Louis Arch</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Acrylic and Printed Material On Canvas</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">23 x 30.5 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

Female masculinity is its own minefield of absurd stereotypes and contradictory mandates around style, manner, and acceptance. Multiple and discordant social pressures constrain and compel people in their self-presentation. In an individual’s attempt to resolve, reject, and navigate expectations, strange affinities and aversions are formed with otherwise benign signifiers. I work with signs that can’t speak, invisibility through high visibility, and fabrics that don’t wrap to describe this left footed jig of gender presentation. Through human scale and large-scale sculptural prints, I poke at the awkward, ugly, lovable dance of socially assigned gender presentation and its consequences.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Burdine/detail3_Burdine.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Untitled</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Ash, Screenprint</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">23 x 39 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Burdine/detail2_Burdine.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Learning To Sew</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Felt, Faux Leather, Embroidery, Gypsum</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">9 x 10 in. and 3 x 3 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

He has revealed our inhumanity and blanketed our insecurities with his humor, turning every part of his life and ours into a joke; illustrating the powerlessness consuming us all.

Born in Ecuador and raised in South Florida I experienced the rapid increasing rate of plastic surgery in young women and divorcees. Experiencing the acceptance of self-objectification has made me question the approval of the unnatural and sport of silicone. In order to better understand our contemporary behavior and sexuality I research anthropology, hominids, and animal interactions. My body of work explores the power of the shape of the round hemispheres of breasts and buttocks, outlining the yonic symbol embodied at the cleavage of both. Through sculpture installations and drawing I exaggerate women’s sexual features and objectify the woman by isolating her to only genitals. It is my theory larger breasts and buttocks are more desirable because of the yonic symbol they create, immediately creating a sexual attraction. According to the Genital Echo Theory in evolution the breast is an echo of the butt. The theory is based on females developing larger breasts around the time hominids began walking upright. My work explores this theory and embodies both transformations into one object. Researcher Desmond Morris argues that the human male seems to be excited by paired, pink, fleshy hemispheres due to his observation of the Gelada female baboons who naturally exhibit sexual availability through their chest. My work focuses on the biological changes women have when sexually active or ovulating, the same characteristics that we alter through cosmetics or surgery (enlarge lips, breast and making eyes appear bigger). Could it be that as a society we are forcing our bodies to change form in order to attract mates from a distance because our societies have become larger groups? It’s my belief our actions are based on the biological reproducing agent inherit in us that we cannot deny.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Calderon/detail_1_Calderon_1.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Bitch Slap</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Soft Pastel On Archival Paper </p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">50 x 83 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Calderon/detail_3_Calderon_1.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Hairy Monkey Fight</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Soft Pastel, Human Hair, Paper</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">60 x 36 in.</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

How the thermostat regulates my body temperature, the way white noise and LED flames regulate my mind and how those things exist on the periphery of my awareness. Some things are designed to be practical background objects, camouflaged for a visual status quo. There is often something captivating and complex about these objects, something subconsciously stirring and frisky that makes them perform differently from their overt purpose. Through my work I help others help me see and think about the peculiarities of the mundane again as if for the first time.<br/><br/>I want to trap light in a dark room, I want to funnel the invisible and capture the unattainable. With aluminum foil I found a physical and audible manifestation of touch in the illusive transfer of energy from one body to another. An object accumulates as the work is performed over time. An object documents and brings material form to the interactions. Similarly we occupy the unseen; for example the space between routers where superficial wireless information connects an object’s activity to the functioning of a device. I often obscure and subvert assumed powers and roles by shifting material, process and context, substituting one quality for another, replacing thoughts by replacing physical matter.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Soerensen/detail_1_Soerensen.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Doorstops of Cranbrook Academy of Art</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Replaced Doorstops, Wood</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">Dimensions Variable</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

I utilize the lens of Art as a way to realize that no one experience is fixed or predetermined, allowing for unexpected outcomes to manifest from seemingly mundane or absurd gestures. The everyday alongside the escapism of film, theater and popular entertainment create a base line connection with the viewer. Allowing the viewer an access point to contemplate the proposed act, inturn carrying that proposition beyond the walls of the gallery and into their daily sensibilities. The end result is a seemingly irrational and folly filled outlook, but the sincerity leaves a tint of optimism; that all possibilities could be, above all, quite ready-made.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Stibich/4_Stibich.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Acoustic Locator</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Traffic Barrel, Stethoscope, Ladder, White Oak</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">Dimensions Variable</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Stibich/2_Stibich.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Dusk: at the laundromat with K Noland</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Stibich, Laundry, Painting</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">1:26:30 Video</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        ",

This key is to the lock on a cage that has held a beast since the last epoch.<br/><br/>The shelf on which the key sits is made of common construction materials - 2x4s and plywood - nothing overly fancy about its construction to draw a patron in, but it is sufficient to hold the key. The sturdy and utilitarian shelf is covered in a thin layer of dust which is constant except for the strip from one of the text about 20 feet down being removed about a year ago. The key has been referenced in a few other sections in the library: Labor, History, Appropriation, and Digital. The patina on the lock that the key fits has long ago turned green. And it was long before that that the lock was last opened. The beast has the strength to remake landscapes and fill in canyons. The current milieu is like a road that has been ridden over so many times that that the ruts feel like a slot car game, and these grooves have become so ingrained that they are determining the direction and destinations available to us. The beast will re-level the ground and smooth out the ruts. Once this has happened the network will be wide open and connections between destinations that have previously been impossible will be possible.<br/><br/>The key is not made of bronze or steel, but is an idea. My work is speculative archeology attempting to excavate the key from history. The forms that this key may take vary from a bus stop surreptitiously installed in a city that has pushed out public transportation to a monument to the failure of architecture consisting of orange construction fencing placed over the location of a past engineering malfunction. They are disruptions to the systematized, mechanized, and privatized world we have inherited from our parents.\n                </div>\n                \n            <div class=\"images\">\n                \n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Warnick/detail_warnick-2.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">It Is A Working Place for Creative Work (The Modern Baptism)</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Artist, Water, History</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">18 Seconds, 83 Years</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Warnick/detail_warnick-3.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">An Artist Without Debt Is No Artist (After Mladen Stilinović)</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Cotton</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\">152 x 182 cm</p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n\n                        <div class=\"img\">\n                            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/Warnick/detail_warnick-1.jpg\">                            \n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"img_caption\">\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_title\">Bus Stop for Bloomfield Hills</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_materials\">Sign, Schedule, Steel Tube, Bloomfield Hills</p>\n                            \n\n                            \n                                <p class=\"img_dementions\"></p>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            </div>\n        "

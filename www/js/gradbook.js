Since 2009: She has been living in Dubai.Bhadviya has hands-on experience as curator, art camp instructor, teaching assistant, video- grapher, advertiser and free- lance graphic designer and photographer.

    "statment":"My work is about how bodies activate a space and how they produce and are produced in a spiritual, social, and material culture. I am interested in awkward, surreal, unnatural, and unor- ganized bodily states by objectifying the body and the space. My work is an examination of how a body in a void space can function as image, figure, excess, or naturalized site for gaze. The in- clusion of the viewer is key in my work. The body and its movement are a metaphor for my state of mind. It is a place where all my conflicts come together in that moment. Having lived three different lives—in India, Dubai and the U.S.—I realized I had developed multiple personalities that helped me fit into each culture while still keeping my own values intact. The bells are sym- bolic of my culture and past and keep me bound, become a rhythm, and constantly remind me who I really am. Traditions can be very impractical and unreasonable, but living in today means being practical and reasonable. There is also a sense of emancipation in my works. This sense of liberation is from the social, spiritual and material world.",

The daughter of two parents who are political refugees, Soleimani inserts her own critical perspectives on his- torical and contemporary socio-political occurrences in Iran. Her current series of works, entitled National Anthem, melds sculpture, col- lage and photography, to create tabletop still lifes that include symbolic lexicons in reference to Iranian politics throughout the past century.",
    "headshot":"SOLEIMANI.jpg",
    "statment":"Within my photographic scenarios, cultural symbols and signifiers are appropriated to cre- ate mash-ups in regards to my position as an Iranian-American viewing the Middle East from an outside lens. By focusing on media trends and the dissemination of societal occurrences through the news, I chose to source imagery from popular media, as well as social media leaks, and adapt them to exist within alternate scenarios. As a practice that serves as a bridge between installation, sculpture, and photographs, my work addresses past historical issues and their connections within a contemporary frame. I first sculpt and install a tabletop tableau, and then photograph the situation as a still life. I chose to use photography to reference the history of propaganda posters, as well as Dada collage. The usage of colors and political figures form a symbolic lexicon that runs throughout the series: specific color choices allude to “color revolutions”, while party supplies hint at the doctrines of political parties. Each of the photographs addresses a specific time in Middle Eastern history, while alluding to how both the East and West have responded to societal occurrences.",

They surround us in the same way as a language surrounds us.” Our interactions with the world have been reduced to the images we access while participating in the endless scroll. All objects are available at our fingertips, and indeed, through the interface of a keyboard and mouse, our fingertips are often the only way we tactilely engage with many of them.

    "statment":"When I am in the studio I feel connected to everything. The sunlight shines in through the trees and the sound of others working keeps me focused on my task.<br /><br />I make coil pots. Sometimes I use a jagged rib to blend the coils but most times I don’t. I like the way coils look; coils speak the language of time and movement—they come together to develop form and move ‘round and ‘round re- minding me that I too have travelled that path.<br /><br />Some of my pots get painted all over with glazes and underglazes; others are left with large areas of raw clay exposed. The faces, colors, and imagery on my pots are inspired by the moment. I like to make decisions very quickly and without much deliberation, paying attention to how they feel. I pick up five ran- dom jugs of color and apply them liberally in heavy globs—I get caught up in watching them cascade down its face—I follow their edges with a carving tool—I know it’s finished when I’m done.<br /><br />I use various firing techniques. I fire my pots in an electric kiln when I want to try and control things or I’ll use a gas kiln with the addition of soda or salt when I want to roll the dice and be surprised. Opening a kiln is always magical.<br /><br />Conceptually, I am enamored of the idea of artistic vision. It’s so puzzling and strange that I have this innate and strong desire to build things and then paint all over them. I often feel anxiety and confusion in trying to understand the paradoxical mix of being and becoming that we call existence; making coil pots keeps me centered. Helping them find their place in the world makes me feel at home.",

Taking the inconsequentially absurd from pop culture and the unconscious along with my own internal existential musings, seems to allow an interesting jux- taposition of seemingly unrelated things. But I realize they are related—like the two sides of a coin, night and day, and the duality of human nature. However, I would like to complicate these things further by blurring the lines and seeing what can exist between the polarities.<br/><br/>Currently, in the context of the subjects aforementioned, drawing has become as central as object making in my practice. The former satisfies my need for immediacy, and the latter op- erates as a way to express the monumental. I believe that seeing the hand in my work is as important as the concept as it assists in lending a sort of honesty; a virtue that is important to me as a maker.<br/><br/>Though not always obvious or present, growing up in a highly politicized area of L.A. and the psychic residual trauma of race relations, gangs, identity, culture, class, apathy, activism, victo- ry and defeat is a motivating factor of my work.

There may be a way to open up what an object means, through its relationship to something else and also by how it is represented. At a certain moment, we have to cross haptic lines and encounter what things actually are: a photo, a readymade, a copy, a blob. I am invested in the things we look past when we are involved with trying to construct a narrative.<br/><br/><strong>Regarding the Use of Images:</strong><br/>False beliefs have the potential to influence the way that we live at the level of reality—just as an image can perform within, and even structure how we understand a situation. Perhaps the perception of real things can become blurred in deceit, and it is not so easy anymore to define which part is the image or the reconstruction, even if we know on a cognitive level exactly what things are.

These behaviors mimic the body, and like with bodily gestures, can express joy, pride, sorrow, and yearning. Despite the artificial color palette of my objects, materials such as silicone, fabric, and steel evoke muscle, skin, and bone which leads to an uncanny familiarity in the work and the desire to touch. Though I do not portray the figure outright, the literal and metaphorical weight is understood through our experience of our own bodies, and how they change with age and according to emotional state—wrinkly skin, slumped posture, knobby toes.

The mobile phone has seamlessly integrated itself into our lives through its usefulness and convenience, and it is one of the few objects we keep almost as close to our bodies as the fabric that divides it from us. Its usefulness began with the ability to communicate with others around the world and near to us at any location we choose (as long as we have service). Yet as we are able to communicate from further away, are our connections to one another as deep as they once were? Although we can peer into each other’s lives with the push of a button, using symbols instead of words to comment on the moments we observe, we pare down our communication with our family and friends, choosing images to convey our thoughts. How has this affected human behavior and relationships? Change is a constant; who we are as people changes every moment. With the advent of social media, our changing selves can be observed by strangers, the government, our employers, our family, and our friends.

A sense of humor has always been important to me, and that is certainly an influence of the un- healthy (borderline dangerous) amount of popular culture that I consume on a daily basis. This pop culture obsession also feeds my fascination with seductive imagery, often in the form of the slick advertisements that I am bombarded with between the tasty nougats of pop culture. Although all those flashing images and pulsing sounds may be rotting my brain – they have taught me that a gleaming surface can be a nice entryway for a subversive idea.",

Sometimes it’s down right messy. I value both.<br/>Design has its own processes. It has provided me with a platform to share my own: loss and grief, identity struggles as a black woman, growing up in an underprivileged background, and the impact of abusive relationships. These messy moments built character that I aimed to understand during my time at Cranbrook. It served as a feedback loop between myself and the audience.<br/>Though we may feel tempted to create for the sake of “art’s sake” or for our own amusement, I believe that design has a greater responsibility to encourage fresh critical thinking about events greater than our selves. I had a great need to combine various elements of the audial, written, and visual communication in my work. Not only did I learn to understand myself more through focus and productivity, I believe that self-determination inspired my passion even more.<br/>I am interested in the sharing of various processes that includes my own and those of others. I look for conversations that are critical but also can provide healthy and productive growth after struggle.

    "statment":"I’m interested in how the porn aesthetic affects status and human behavior. Born in Ecuador and raised in South Florida I experienced the rapid increasing rate of plastic surgery in young women and divorcees. Experiencing the acceptance of self-objectification has made me question the approval of the unnatural and sport of silicone. In order to better understand our contemporary behavior and sexuality I research anthropology, hominids, and animal interactions. My body of work explores the power of the shape of the round hemispheres of breasts and buttocks, outlining the yonic symbol embodied at the cleavage of both. Through sculpture installations and drawing I exaggerate women’s sexual features and objectify the woman by isolating her to only genitals. It is my theory larger breasts and buttocks are more desirable because of the yonic symbol they create, immediately creating a sexual attraction. According to the Genital Echo Theory in evolution the breast is an echo of the butt. The theory is based on females developing larger breasts around the time hominids began walking upright. My work explores this theory and embodies both transformations into one object. Researcher Desmond Morris argues that the human male seems to be excited by paired, pink, fleshy hemispheres due to his observation of the Gelada female baboons who naturally exhibit sexual availability through their chest. My work focuses on the biological changes women have when sexually active or ovulating, the same characteristics that we alter through cosmetics or surgery (enlarge lips, breast and making eyes appear bigger). Could it be that as a society we are forcing our bodies to change form in order to attract mates from a distance because our societies have become larger groups? It’s my belief our actions are based on the biological reproducing agent inherit in us that we cannot deny.",

    "statment":"There exists in the deep recesses of a large dusty library in a forgotten corner of an ivy covered liberal arts college a book that contains a key. This key is to the lock on a cage that has held a beast since the last epoch.<br/><br/>The shelf on which the key sits is made of common construction materials - 2x4s and plywood - nothing overly fancy about its construction to draw a patron in, but it is sufficient to hold the key. The sturdy and utilitarian shelf is covered in a thin layer of dust which is constant except for the strip from one of the text about 20 feet down being removed about a year ago. The key has been referenced in a few other sections in the library: Labor, History, Appropriation, and Digital. The patina on the lock that the key fits has long ago turned green. And it was long before that that the lock was last opened. The beast has the strength to remake landscapes and fill in canyons. The current milieu is like a road that has been ridden over so many times that that the ruts feel like a slot car game, and these grooves have become so ingrained that they are determining the direction and destinations available to us. The beast will re-level the ground and smooth out the ruts. Once this has happened the network will be wide open and connections between destinations that have previously been impossible will be possible.<br/><br/>The key is not made of bronze or steel, but is an idea. My work is speculative archeology attempting to excavate the key from history. The forms that this key may take vary from a bus stop surreptitiously installed in a city that has pushed out public transportation to a monument to the failure of architecture consisting of orange construction fencing placed over the location of a past engineering malfunction. They are disruptions to the systematized, mechanized, and privatized world we have inherited from our parents.",
